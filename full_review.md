# Full Review

During this 1 year and 10 months I worked in BCM, I built a productive working style, I learnt to use many tools/concepts and I build things that I am proud of. I will brief my work and my life in this review.

## Coming back to IT
When I was in la casa del habanos, I felt the inner urge of exploring the world. I knew that my IT background is an advantage since IT skillset is standardized and migratable and it might lead me the way. I start to review some IT project I have done and recall IT concepts. As you might see, my entry of index.xlsx in code_library starts at Nov, 2015.  

## Start from scratch
Soon I am offered by BCM as senior programmer. I went onboard at Dec 1st, 2015. At this timep point I knows nothing on open-source community, I have no software development experience and I have negative feeling toward being a programmer(bored and bad for eye-sight) 

## Build the concept

## Surfing in different concepts

## Things connected

## My tools, My habbits and My Own Style

## Next step

## Apart from the details, lets talk spirit
